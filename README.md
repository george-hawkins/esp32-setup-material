===================

This project contains the [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) resources that are meant to accompany my [ESP32 setup](https://github.com/george-hawkins/esp32-setup) project.

See [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md) for details on how the project was created.
